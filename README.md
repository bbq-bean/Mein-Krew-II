### TODO in order:

- ~~as guest scrape given Twitch channel for the leader comments~~
- containerize and build IaC for EKS pods in public subnets(we need unique IPs per account)
- now with unique source IPs and accounts, create bot member account login functionality
- add simple bot responses in chat to leader comments(haha, lol)
- Integrate LLM to pass "are you a bot?" comments directed @ bots
- Add feature for bots to follow leader when channel switches
- Enjoy Twitch chat with bot friends, profit.
